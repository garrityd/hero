      <h3>My Hero</h3>
      <p>Heros are very important to people. A hero helps give confidence andalso can help guide where someone takes their life. A hero can allow for self improvement and give the courage and will to keep going even when times are tough. This hero site is dedicated to my hero, Albert Einstein.</p>
      <p>Albert Einstein is my hero because he had the courage to go against an ancient system of mathematics that did not fully describe how the universe worked. He broke new ground in physiucs and mathematics which allowed for much of the technology thay we have today. Einstein created the calculations that allow us to study the stars and black holes. We are still today working on new ways to use his calculations such as fusion reactors which are a safe alternative power source that has no carbon or waste output.</p>
